# Ultimate-Moe
Ultimate Moe is the first arcade-style game I ever created using JS, HTML, and CSS. I was 12 years old and the time and wholly mostly from books and the internet. The goal is to step on all of the evil red rectangles (Mario-style) by jumping with the spacebar. Enjoy!
To use, simply download the HTMl document and open it using a browser. Reccommended browser is Google Chrome. You can look through the code to see my thought process and commments if you would like. Feel free to release your inner child and go full ninja mode.
